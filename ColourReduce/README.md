# ColourReduce

This is a small subproject related to the MushroomPictureToxicity project. In this subproject, I aim to have application that when given a picture (through an attachment or camera) will reduce it to a certain amount of colours. This will be done through the K-Means algorithm.

The intention here is to practice for doing basically the same thing for my actual big project. Here, I'll be doing the whole phone/computer application shebang and get some experience in deploying ML models.
